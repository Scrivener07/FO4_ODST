## [Camouflage Cloak](https://www.halopedia.org/Camouflage_cloak)
Camouflage cloaks are devices employed by the UNSC as a medium of concealing its soldiers in certain environments. Though crude by the standards of the Covenant's active camouflage technology, the camouflage cloak still gives humans an advantage.

The camouflage cloak can be worn over most armors, including advanced suits such as MJOLNIR armor. These cloaks not only contain passive camouflage patterns to fool inattentive enemies, the cloak also masks the thermal signatures of the wearer to avoid detection.

Similar technology, photoreactive panels, were physically integrated into the SPI armor, an armor system used by members of the SPARTAN-III Program as well as UNSC Prowlers in form of texture buffers.

The Visual Intelligence System, Reconnaissance, abbreviated as VISR, is a proprietary integrated data management system incorporated into the helmets of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers.
